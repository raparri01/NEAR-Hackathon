## Overview 
One Labs is a NFT anlaytics platform for NEAR. Based on user defined appetite, it provides NFT signals and trends. 

## Inspiration
1. The NEAR Protocol is the great platform for NFTs due to its faster speed, lower gas fees, easier and efficient execution for user transactions, over Ethereum. 
2. These comparative advantages make NEAR attractive for NFT creation / buy / sell transactions and there are several outstanding NFT projects on the NEAR blockchain. 
3. NEAR's aforementioned factors would be a great alternative solution for new NFT creators and collectors due to lower costs of entry.

An NFT analytics platform providing important transaction signals and trends for NFT projects on NEAR would help new and existing NFT creators and collectors to choose and grow NEAR community together.
