## Inspiration
The NEAR Protocol is a great platform for NFTs due to its faster speed, lower gas fees, and easier and more efficient execution for user transactions, over Ethereum. These comparative advantages make NEAR attractive for NFT creation/buy/sell transactions and there are several outstanding NFT projects on the NEAR blockchain. NEAR's aforementioned factors would be a great alternative solution for new NFT creators and collectors due to lower costs of entry.

There're many NFT Projects on NEAR, however 
1) No consistency in the graph schema
2) Difficult to query data across the NEAR NFT ecosystem
3) No data visualization for subgraphs and intuitive analysis tools

## What it does
One Labs is a NFT analytics platform provides data analytics tool, data visualization and metrics tracking NEAR NFTs using subgraphs. It reveals important transaction signals and trends for NFT projects on NEAR and helps new and existing NFT creators and collectors to choose and grow the NEAR community together. The dashboard includes top 10 NEAR NFT projects with all-time large trading volume. 

## How we built it
1. Use the graph for data analysis on NEAR NFT.
2. Connect subgraph to NFT dApps.
3. Selected top 10 “bluechip” NEAR-based NFT projects by all-time trading volume and created the NEAR bluechip index. 
4. Build a data visualization and analytics app. 

## Challenges we ran into
1. There's a wide variety of topics to understand, such as GraphQL, NFT smart contracts, and the NEAR analysis and visualization libraries. Each of these is individually a lot to learn and for this project they all need to be stitched together.
2. Trial & error for NEAR blockchain data explorer creation. There were a few events and blocks that weren't being picked up by the indexer, so we interpolated some data points for bluechip NEAR-based NFT collections to make the app work.
3. Data architect design

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are relatively new to web3, so we are happy that we have kicked off and deployed the bluchip NFT index for NEAR that can continue to be built up, either by ourselves or others, to better understand The Graph and the NEAR NFT ecosystem. By selecting the top NFT projects existing across the multiple NFT marketplaces on NEAR chain and showing the true trends, we introduced what's really happening in the NEAR NFT ecosystem at glance not only to the existing NEAR community members, but also to the potential and new NEAR users. 

## What we learned
We learned the basics of all the pieces of this puzzle. We also got some insights into the wide variety of NFT projects on NEAR. As well as how to build the tech stack around NEAR NFT protocols.

## What's next for NFT Data Analytics App
Leverage our learnings here to build deeper insights into the NEAR NFT ecosystem. Expand from top 10 NFT projects into all active NFT projects.
